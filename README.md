## Descriptions of the jupyter nootbooks saved in notebooks
### [ih-slope-analysis.ipynb](/notebooks/ih-slope-analysis.ipynb)
The goal of this script is identifying drug responders based on the change of holding current slopes.

This file loads a set of abf, generates smoothed holding current by averaging adjacent data points, and get the linear regression slopes of the data segments generated by given rolling window. 

The most negative slope during drug application period is compared with the slope during baseline period. Cells that meet the criteria of slope difference are considered as drug respnders.

### [spike-inactivation.ipynb](/notebooks/spike-inactivation.ipynb)
The goal of this script is to calculate the duration of the non-AP-block silence during current step protocol.
